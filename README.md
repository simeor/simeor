### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Simeo, an experienced, team-oriented, front-end software engineer. With strong interpersonal skills and over two years of hands-on industry experience, efficiently developing and maintaining live large-scale products using React with Typescript.

Here you find older projects from when I was first learning to code, along with some newer repositories. These are used to provide proof of concept playgounds for work and team knowledge share sessions.
